# to-do

This was made using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [EJS](http://ejs.co/) and [MongoDB Node.JS](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) at the backend.

To run this, you need to set up a local MongoDB server or change the address, to an already existing one in `/server.js`.

First, install the dependencies by doing : `npm install`.
And the start the server by using `npm start` ot `npm run dev`.

Please note that this uses the `item` collection in the `to-do` database. If you are already using that, change it in `/server.js`.
